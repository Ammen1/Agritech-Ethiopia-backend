## Overview

Welcome to **Agritech Ethiopia**, a revolutionary project aimed at transforming and enhancing the agricultural sector in Ethiopia. This repository houses both the web-based platform and the mobile application components of our project. Our mission is to empower Ethiopian farmers with knowledge, resources, and a seamless digital ecosystem to improve their agricultural practices and livelihoods.

## Project Scope

### Web Platform and Mobile Application

**Crop Information:** We provide detailed information about various crops, including planting, harvesting, and pest control guidelines.

**Mobile-Friendly Marketplace:** Our mobile app features a user-friendly marketplace, making buying and selling agricultural products convenient on the go. Key marketplace functionalities include:

- **Search for resources:** Easily search for agricultural products and resources.
- **Create resources:** List your agricultural products for sale with details like type, quantity, price, and location.
- **Share resources:** Connect with buyers and sellers, and communicate seamlessly within the platform.

**Payment and Transactions:** We've integrated a secure payment gateway that supports local payment methods commonly used in Ethiopia. You can also track your buying and selling activities through the transaction history feature.

**Product Listings:** Users can upload images and descriptions of the products they want to sell. Edit, mark as sold, or remove listings as needed.

**Chat and Communication:** Our messaging system enables direct communication between buyers and sellers within the platform. You'll receive notifications for new messages and updates on your listings.

**Verification and Trustworthiness:** We've implemented a user verification process to build trust. Verified users will have badges displayed on their profiles.

**Geolocation:** Use geolocation features to find products and sellers near your location.

**Support and Assistance:** Our platform offers customer support to assist with any buying or selling issues. You can also access a help center or FAQs to address common questions.

**Feedback and Improvement:** We encourage users to provide feedback on their marketplace experiences to help us enhance the platform continually.

**Security and Privacy:** We take data security seriously, ensuring your personal information is handled securely and your privacy is maintained.

**Local Language Support:** To make the platform accessible to a wider user base, we offer support in local languages spoken in Ethiopia.

## Disease Prediction System

Our project includes an advanced disease prediction system that helps farmers identify diseases affecting their agricultural products. This system covers a variety of crops, including tomato, potato, coffee leaf, and more. Here's how it works:

- **Upload Image:** Users can upload images of their crops or leaves that show signs of disease.

- **AI-Based Diagnosis:** We utilize cutting-edge AI models, including ResNet and custom-trained models, to analyze the uploaded images and identify potential diseases.

- **Timely Recommendations:** Once the disease is identified, our system provides timely recommendations for treatment or prevention. This information is crucial for farmers to take appropriate action to protect their crops.

- **Multiple Crop Support:** Our disease prediction system is versatile and supports various crops commonly found in Ethiopia, ensuring that farmers receive accurate guidance for their specific agricultural needs.

This system enhances our platform's value by providing farmers with a powerful tool to address crop diseases promptly and effectively, ultimately improving crop yields and agricultural practices.
